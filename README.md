This repository, hold the first 18 tutorials, out of 25 total.  These are my notes, from the C# tutorials, created by Derek Banas,
noted, in the link above.  The last 6 tutorials (19- 25) where created in a different project, because thier main requirements, differed from
the requirements from the first 18.  18-25 can be found here:

I'm sure, there are plenty of spelling, grmatical and other syntax errors, in the explanations and comments, but the code has all been tested, and works. 
I added this, and many other tutorials to my Github account, as proof of completion, of these tutorials, for my use in a resume, and as a learning tool; 
to learn how to use Github, and its integration within Visual Studio.

My thanks to Derek Banas, for all the tutorials. He is the author of the tutorials, and therefore, in my eyes, the proprietor of the rules governing 
the use of this information. Since the tutorials where free, I assume these pages can be shared, freely.
